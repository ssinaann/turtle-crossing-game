# Turtle Crossy Road

## Overview
In this game, you control a turtle trying to cross a busy road filled with moving cars. 
The objective is to safely guide your turtle from the bottom of the screen to the top without getting hit by the cars. 
As you progress, the game becomes more challenging with increasing car speed.

This project is built using Python's `turtle` graphics module and follows Object-Oriented Programming principles, making the game logic modular and easy to understand.
